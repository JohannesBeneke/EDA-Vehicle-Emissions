# Explorative Data Analysis - CO₂ Emissions

## Objective
In this notebook, the CO₂ emissions based on the fuel consumption of vehicles in Canada in 2020 are analyzed. The main objective is to identify the characteristics of vehicles that have the greatest impact on the vehicle emissions. Another objective is to identify correlations between features from which new information can be derived. Finally, the dataset is prepared for the use of a machine learning algorithm.
